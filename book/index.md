# Introduction
**Dapp Platform with Trustless Off-Chain Access**

Our passion is to connect **transparency** of a decentralized system and **convenience** of a centralized system. Kogarashi Network is a Dapp platform that allows trustless and low-cost interaction with the Internet. Dapp providers can build decentralized services closer to the real world by putting Internet data into smart contracts. Trustless Oracle extension allow smart contracts to deal with a variety of type and property of data ever before.

## Functionality

Kogarashi Network provides a Dapp development environment capable of access to Internet data and using it for smart contracts. Dapp providers decide which information resource is used and how to process response data. The smart contract can verify the following things.

- Internet data is fetched from the valid data resource
- Data is processed correctly

## Benefit

Existing off-chain Oracle service uses majority decision to verify the data thus Dapp providers need to pay expensive costs to ensure the reliability. It's a trade-off relationship between cost and reliability. However, Kogarashi Network uses protocol verification instead. It can realize cheap costs and reliability.

Kogarashi Network also supports the Oracle function as a built-in development environment. Dapp providers don't need to connect the Dapp platform and Oracle service. These features realize a seamless development process.

- **Development**: Connection between the Dapp platform and Oracle service is unnecessary
- **Operation**: Getting data cost is cheap

## Future

Blockchain realized a global transparent trading system. Kogarashi Network extends the type and property of data used on smart contracts. Traditional blockchain use cases are limited in the **financial** area but Kogarashi Network realizes **non-financial** area use cases and Dapp services are closer to people's everyday life.
