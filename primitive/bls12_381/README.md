# Bls12 381

**This crate partly uses [https://github.com/dusk-network/bls12_381](https://github.com/dusk-network/bls12_381) and [https://github.com/dusk-network/bls12_381](https://github.com/dusk-network/bls12_381) implementation designed by Dusk-Network team and, @str4d and @ebfull.**
We replace field and curve implementation with `zero-crypto` to make this compatible with `Substrate`.
