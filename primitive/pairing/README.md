# Tate Pairing [![crates.io badge](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/zero-pairing.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/zero-pairing)

**This crate uses [https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381](https://github.com/zkcrypto/bls12_381) algorithm designed by @str4d and @ebfull.**
We replace field and curve implementation with `zero-crypto` to make this compatible with `Substrate`.
