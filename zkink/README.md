# zkink!

## Abstract
This is the eDSL for confidential contract executions and forked originally by [`ink! v3.0.0`](https://github.com/paritytech/ink/tree/v3.0.0). The transactions validity is proved by `plonk` proof. With this `zkink!`, we can develop privacy preserving smart contract. We are implementing following functionalities.

- Encrypted Smart Contract Storage
- Proof Verification eDSL
- Zero Knowledge Friendly Compiler
