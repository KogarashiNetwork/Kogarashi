//! Types and abstractions for ink! definitions that require custom syntax.

//! # Note
//!
//! In general we try not to require any sort of custom non-standard Rust

//!
//! At the time of this writing we currently only use this for the argument
//! parsing of ink! configuration header `#[ink(env = my::env::Types, ...)]`
//! in order to be able to parse identifiers in `name = value` segments for
//! the `value` part.
