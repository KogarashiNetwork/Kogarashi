//! Utilities in use by ink!.
//!
//! These are kept separate from ink core utilities to allow for more dynamic inter-crate dependencies.
//! The main problem is that today Cargo manages crate features on a per-crate basis instead of
//! a per-crate-target basis thus making dependencies from `ink_lang` (or others) to `ink_env` or `ink_storage` impossible.
//!
//! By introducing `ink_primitives` we have a way to share utility components between `ink_env` or `ink_storage` and
//! other parts of the framework, like `ink_lang`.
