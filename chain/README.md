# Substrate Node

A fresh FRAME-based [Substrate](https://www.substrate.io/) node, ready for hacking :rocket:

## Getting Started

### Build

The `cargo run` command will perform an initial build. Use the following command to build the node
without launching it:

```sh
sh scripts/setup.sh
```

### Run

Use Rust's native `cargo` command to build and launch the template node:

```sh
cargo run
```
